Implementing important components of a React Native app

# Running

* Each React Native project can be run in either iOS or Android by following the [React Native Getting Started Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies). Once you get to the **Creating a new application** step, follow these steps:
  * `cd` into the project directory that you wish to run
  * `npm install`
  * `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
    * Or open the project in Xcode or Android Studio, and run the project from there
